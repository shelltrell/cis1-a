CIS 1-A Students, 
###Mid Term Writing Assignment
Please view the Mid Term, posted here. 


###9/02/2015
Thank you for making excellent effort during the first two weeks to attend lecture. I appreciate this and look forward to working with each of you. 

Each term I am obligated to drop all students who have not attended one hour of lab time in our MLK facility. I will do so Sunday evening. 

To avoid being dropped, you can do one of the following things: 
1) attend MLK lab tomorrow  (one hour minimum, please check its operating hours)
2) send me your lab exercise (week one or two) via email (stefan.bund@rccd.edu)

Thanks again. Letâ€™s work together to secure your spot!
